website is under development

Priority 1 is the webshop. It’s a webshop that will be generated for every group that sells, personally (the name of the group should show on the webshop when customers go in to order, so they can see which group they are ordering from).
The webshop should also have the ability to be shared to customers by link or QR-code. All orders should be without payment, and will be received by the the website owner.

Priority 2 is the administrative page, where the group that are selling gets invited to. In this page, the leader of the group has a link he can share to invite the other people of the group in to the administrative page. They all can see how many products each person in the group have sold. And they all have their own sharing link to the webshop, so for example if “Peter” shares his webshop link to a customer who ends up ordering, the order should register in Peters name, so the rest of the group can see how many products Peter have sold.
